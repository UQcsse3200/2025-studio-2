:
Have you considered a different hobby? Like {WAVE}breathing{ENDWAVE}?
Maybe try plugging in the controller?
Your journey ends here...
You are the reason games have an "easy" mode.
Are you allergic to success?
I'm not angry, I'm just {SICK}disappointed{ENDSICK}.
That was, without a doubt, the least impressive thing I have ever seen
This is another test prompt but longer so that we can test this thing
Don't worry, your last save was...  a long, long time ago.
I'd say "better luck next time" but.{WAIT=0.25}.{WAIT=0.25}.{WAIT=0.5} let's be realistic.
{RAINBOW}you died a horrible death{ENDRAINBOW}
{RAINBOW}A truly monumental failure.{ENDRAINBOW}
Well, that was {WAVE}embarrassing{ENDWAVE}...
{SHAKE}OOPS!{ENDSHAKE}
{SICK}Skill issue{ENDSICK} detected
Maybe try the {WAVE}tutorial{ENDWAVE} next time?
{COLOR=RED}{SHAKE}FATALITY!{ENDSHAKE}{ENDCOLOR}
{COLOR=RED}{SHAKE}WASTED{ENDSHAKE}{ENDCOLOR}
{SICK}Git gud{ENDSICK}
{SHAKE}Pathetic.{ENDSHAKE}
Try again? Maybe not.
Congratulations! You've unlocked the {SHAKE}death screen{ENDSHAKE} achievement!
I'm starting to think you're doing this on purpose.
This is just getting sad. Please stop.
Natural selection at work.
That looked like it hurt. Noice.

TrapComponent:
Pro Tip: The pointy things are the bad things. Imagin that!
That's one way to get some iron in your diet.
You've been outsmarted by a stationary object.
Congratulations, you've discovered another sharp object.
It was literally right there. Open your eyes!
You have a magnetic personality. For pointy things.
A rather {COLOR=RED}sharp{ENDCOLOR} lesson in situational awareness.
{SHAKE}It's a spike pit, not a suggenstion to jump.{ENDSHAKE}
You've been {COLOR=RED}perforated{ENDCOLOR}.
I'm not even sure how you managed to hit it from that angle.{WAIT=0.4} It's almost{WAIT=0.4} impressive.
That trap has a higher KD ratio than you.
The trap was just doing its job. You, on the other hand...
A pointy trap{WAIT=0.5}, and a blunt instrument.

DeathZoneComponent:
Embraced the void.
That landing was a perfect 10.{WAIT=0.75} On the Richter scale.
It's a long way down.{WAIT=0.75} Or it was.
You just ran out of ground...
{WAVE}{FADE}Wiiiiieeeeeeeeee{WAIT=0.25}...{WAIT=0.25}{ENDFADE} splat.{ENDWAVE}
Did you think there was an invisible floor there?{WAIT=0.75} {SICK}Adorable.{ENDSICK}
You've explored the world's vertical limits.{WAIT=0.5} The lower ones.
The abyss stared back{WAIT=0.25}.{WAIT=0.25}.{WAIT=0.25}. and laughed.
You believe You can fly? {WAIT=0.5}The ground respectfully disagrees.
You've found the express lane to the {SHAKE}game over screen{ENDSHAKE}.
That wasn't a shortcut.{WAIT=0.75} It was a stupid-cut.
Gravity: 1, You: 0.
Congratulations, you've hit the Terminal velocity.
Try {WAVE}flapping{ENDWAVE} your arms next time.
That was a leap of faith.{WAIT=0.75} The faith was misplaced.
You've become a permanent part of the landscape.

Drone:
Even the robots think you're obsolete.
That thing's got better pathfinding than your life choices.
That drone is telling its drone friends about how easy it was.
{FADE}5{WAIT=0.125}3 {WAIT=0.125}6{WAIT=0.125}B {WAIT=0.125}6{WAIT=0.125}9 {WAIT=0.125}6{WAIT=0.125}C {WAIT=0.125}6{WAIT=0.125}C {WAIT=0.125}2{WAIT=0.125}0 {WAIT=0.125}4{WAIT=0.125}9 {WAIT=0.125}7{WAIT=0.125}3 {WAIT=0.125}73 {WAIT=0.125}7{WAIT=0.125}5 {WAIT=0.125}6{WAIT=0.125}5{ENDFADE}
{COLOR=CYAN}Resistance is futile.{ENDCOLOR}
Outsmarted by a flying toaster with an attitude problem.
Calculating... {WAIT=1}Threat level -1.
It's just following its programming. You on the other hand
That drone runs on logic.{WAIT=0.25} You? {WAIT=0.5}excuses!

AutonomousBoxComponent:
The cave sends its regards.
That was bat-tently a skill issue.
That thing navigates in the dark better than you do in broad daylight.
It moves in a predictable patterns.{WAIT=0.75} {SICK}Unlike your brain{ENDSICK}.
It's got a simple flight path. Were you mesmerised by the flapping?
You just got outplayed by a bird.
It's not even trying to kill you.{WAIT=0.75} You're just in the way.
{SHAKE}Defeated by a screensaver.{ENDSHAKE}
Outmaneuvered by a rodent.
That bat's brain is the size of a pea.{WAIT=0.75} It's than you were using.
Holy smokes, {FADE}Batman!{ENDFADE} {WAIT=0.5}{SICK}You're really bad at this{ENDSICK}.
Echolocation works better than your eyeballs apparently.
HOWWW!{WAIT=0.75} It barely does any damage duuudeeee
That thing. It barely has a hitbox!
It has no strategy. Still one more strategy than apparently.

BombComponent:
You're officially a part of the blast radius.
Some assembly required.{WAIT=0.8} Lots of it.
{SHAKE}{COLOR=ORANGE}KABOOM!{ENDCOLOR}{ENDSHAKE} {WAIT=0.5} Were you expecting a hug?
You're now an abstract painting on the ceiling.
Achievement Unlocked: {COLOR=RED}Spontaneous combustion{ENDCOLOR}.
We'll get a mop.{WAIT=0.8} Eventually.
{FADE}You've been scattered across the room.{ENDFADE}
That was a blast!
You volunteered as tribute to the god of explosions.
Looks like you're all over the place.
That bomb had a short fuse but you had a shorter lifespan.
You've been reduced to a soup.
You have an {SICK}explosive{ENDSICK} personality.{WAIT=0.8} {SHAKE}*had{ENDSHAKE}.
You've been {COLOR=RED}de-atomized.{ENDCOLOR}
That's what happens when you bring a knife to a bomb fight.
