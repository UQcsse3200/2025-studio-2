{COLOR=RED}CyberCorp{CLEARCOLOR}, once a great technology giant whose innovations were found nearly everywhere on Earth, now holds a monopoly over the human race itself.
In 2065, its vast facility emitted an {SHAKE}ear-splitting{ENDSHAKE} signal that spread through satellite networks, device speakers, and intercom systems across the planet.

{COLOR=RED}Cybernetic implants{CLEARCOLOR} - accessories as common as smartphones in the early 21st century — were overridden by that signal, granting {SICK}total control{ENDSICK} over their users' minds.
Living conditions deteriorated, structures collapsed, and governments fell as a mysterious entity within {COLOR=RED}CyberCorp{CLEARCOLOR} executed its grand plan.

It's 2077, and society stands on the brink of collapse. The remaining humans — like myself — will soon {SHAKE}perish{ENDSHAKE}.
A sentient, all-encompassing {COLOR=RED}Artificial Intelligence{CLEARCOLOR} now controls everything, commanding the mindless human–machine hybrids that serve its will.
Small pockets of humanity are watched by {COLOR=RED}surveillance drones{CLEARCOLOR} and {COLOR=RED}transhuman soldiers{CLEARCOLOR}, as if we’re the subjects of some twisted {SICK}science experiment{ENDSICK}.
We’re forced into the labour the AI cannot yet automate, and even made to purchase our own oxygen since it harvested and controls what remains of Earth’s supply.

Now I’ve reached it, and my objective is clear: {COLOR=YELLOW}{SLOWER}{SHRINK}Eliminate the AI threat — or perish trying.{ENDSHRINK}{SLOWER}{CLEARCOLOR}
