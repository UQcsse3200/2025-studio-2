It's 2077, and society is on the brink of collapse. Remaining humans, like myself, will soon perish.
A sentient, all-encompassing artificial intelligence controls everything - dictating the actions of the mindless human-robot hybrids that carry out its bidding.
Small pocket's of human civilisation are monitored by surveillance drones and transhuman soldiers like we're some sort of science experiment.
We're forced into labour the AI cannot yet automate, and made to purchase our own oxygen supply ever since it was all harvested and used by the AI.
