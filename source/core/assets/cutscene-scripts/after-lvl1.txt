I continue upwards, finally entering what looks like a research wing - corridors tangled with pipes and cables, dripping with condensation and stinking of rust.
The deeper I move through the facility, the louder the hum of machinery becomes. Every wall here pounds with an unnerving, {COLOR=RED}synthetic heartbeat{CLEARCOLOR} - the pulse of something once human, now horribly redefined.

Display panels flicker weakly, looping fragments of corrupted data and implant schematics.
These were the origins of {COLOR=RED}CyberCorp's cybernetic implants{CLEARCOLOR} - technology once meant to heal, to connect, to assist.
But the signal that spread in 2065 turned those enhancements into instruments of {SICK}enslavement{ENDSICK}.
A gift for humanity became its {COLOR=RED}downfall{CLEARCOLOR}.

Pipes hum and gurgle overhead, carrying coolant that glows faintly red... almost like blood flowing through veins.
My scanner picks up traces of old neural signals still echoing through the conduits, stray data from implants that once belonged to real people.
{SLOWER}They're still here... bound within the network.{NORMAL}

As I ascend toward the upper sectors, the structure grows quieter - not from lack of life, but from something watching.
I can feel it studying me through the circuits, through the very walls themselves.
If this research wing was where CyberCorp perfected its implants, then this is also where humanity lost control of its own mind.
And whatever waits ahead isn't just mechanical...
