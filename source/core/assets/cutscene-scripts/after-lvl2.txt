As I continue my ascent of the facility, I'm finding the abundance of cybernetic life increasingly apparent... And hostile.
This hellscape is becoming more and more difficult to navigate. This next part of the facility seems especially vertical.
But even with these difficulties, there's no turning back now.
I never thought I'd make it this far in, and I know I'll soon be encroaching upon the central AI's domain.
