Administrator Deacon,
I have completed the corrective action plan for the incident we had a few weeks ago. To keep things short, the control subsystem detected a large power anomaly throughout multiple areas in the facility. While we originally were chalking this up to be some hardware fault, the logs are showing something more strange. It looks like the central AI started issuing random system protocols all at once sometime around 3:15AM. Our system couldn't handle the load, and it seems at some point the AI itself lost power and shutdown, which gave the facility time to recover. We're keeping it offline for now and just switching back to manual facility management until we can figure out how and why it did that.
